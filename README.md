# Project Architecture

```
frontend/
 ├── components
 ├── pages
 │    ├── Buyer
 │    └── Seller
 ├── router
 └── api.js

backend/
 ├── api
 │    ├── models.py
 │    ├── views.py
 │    ├── serializers.py
 │    └── urls.py
 └── backend
      └── settings.py
```

Architecture follows a **Vue SPA + Django API pattern**:

* Vue handles UI and routing
* Django provides API endpoints
* Axios connects frontend to backend

---

# Database Design

Main entities:

* **User**
* **Buyer**
* **Seller**

 │
 └── Seller
        └── Product
